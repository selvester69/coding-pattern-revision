# Stack-Based Problems

This repository contains implementations of various stack-based problems, commonly asked in coding interviews and competitive programming.

## Problems Covered

### Nearest Greater/Smaller Element
- **Nearest Greater to Left**: Find the nearest greater element to the left for each element in an array.
- **Nearest Greater to Right**: Find the nearest greater element to the right for each element in an array.
- **Nearest Smaller to Left**: Find the nearest smaller element to the left for each element in an array.
- **Nearest Smaller to Right**: Find the nearest smaller element to the right for each element in an array.

### Stack and Histogram Problems
- **Stock Span Problem**: Determines how many consecutive days before a given day had a lower stock price.
- **Maximum Area of Histogram**: Computes the largest rectangular area that can be formed in a histogram.
- **Maximum Area of Rectangle in a Binary Matrix**: Finds the largest rectangle of 1s in a binary matrix.
- **Rainwater Trapping**: Calculates the total amount of water trapped between bars after rainfall.

### Stack Implementations
- **Implementing Min Stack**: A stack that supports `push()`, `pop()`, `top()`, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
- **Implement Stack Using Heap**: Implementing a stack using a heap (priority queue).

### Miscellaneous Stack Problems
- **Celebrity Problem**: Find the celebrity in a party where a celebrity is known by everyone but knows no one.
- **Longest Valid Parentheses**: Find the length of the longest valid substring of parentheses.
- **Iterative Tower of Hanoi**: Solving the Tower of Hanoi problem iteratively using a stack.
