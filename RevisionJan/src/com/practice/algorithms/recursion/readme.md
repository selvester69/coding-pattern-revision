# Recursion and Backtracking Problems

This repository contains a collection of classic problems related to **recursion**, **backtracking**, and **combinatorics**. These are commonly asked in technical interviews and help build a deep understanding of recursive problem solving.

## 📂 Problem List

### 🔢 Binary Trees
- **Height of Binary Tree**  
  Recursively calculate the maximum depth (or height) of a binary tree.

### 📊 Sorting using Recursion
- **Sort an Array using Recursion**  
  Implement recursive approach to sort an array without using loops.
  
- **Sort a Stack using Recursion**  
  Use recursion to sort a stack in ascending order.
  
- **Delete Middle Element of Stack using Recursion**  
  Remove the middle element from a stack using only recursive calls.
  
- **Reverse Stack using Recursion**  
  Reverse the elements of a stack without using any additional data structures.

### 🧬 String and Sequence Manipulation
- **K-th Symbol in Grammar**  
  Recursively find the K-th symbol in the N-th row of a special grammar sequence.

- **Tower of Hanoi**  
  Solve the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion.

- **Print Subsets / Power Sets / All Subsequences**  
  Generate all possible subsets (or subsequences) of a given string or array.

- **Print Unique Subsets and Variations**  
  Handle duplicate elements to print only unique subsets.

- **Permutations with Space**  
  Insert spaces in different positions between characters to form variations.

- **Permutations with Case Change**  
  Generate permutations by changing the case of each character.

- **Letter Case Permutations**  
  Similar to case change problem — useful for alphanumeric strings.

- **Generate All Balanced Parenthesis**  
  Print all combinations of balanced parentheses for given number of pairs.

- **Print N-bit Binary Numbers with More 1s than 0s**  
  Generate binary strings of length N where the count of 1s is always ≥ count of 0s at any prefix.

### 🧩 Combinatorics and Recursion Puzzles
- **Josephus Problem (Circle of Death)**  
  Solve the classic elimination puzzle using recursion.
