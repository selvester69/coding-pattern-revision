# Binary Search Playlist

## Core Binary Search Concepts

* **Binary Search Format Introduction:** Setting the stage for understanding the general binary search approach.
* **Binary Search:** The fundamental implementation of binary search on a sorted array.
* **Binary Search on Reverse Sorted Array:** Adapting binary search for arrays sorted in descending order.
* **Order Not Known Search:** Implementing binary search when the sorting order of the array is unknown.

## Finding Elements and Their Properties

* **First and Last occurrence of an Element:** Finding the indices of the first and last occurrences of a given element in a sorted array.
* **Count of an Element in a Sorted Array:** Determining the total number of occurrences of a specific element.
* **Number of Times a Sorted array is Rotated:** Finding the number of rotations performed on a sorted array.
* **Find an Element in a Rotated Sorted Array:** Searching for an element in a sorted array that has been rotated.
* **Searching in a Nearly Sorted Array:** Applying binary search to arrays where elements are at most one position away from their sorted order.

## Finding Boundaries and Neighbors

* **Find Floor of an element in a Sorted Array:** Finding the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to the target.
* **Ceil of an element in a Sorted Array:** Finding the smallest element in the array that is greater than or equal to the target.
* **Next Alphabetical Element:** Finding the smallest character in a sorted array of characters that is greater than the target character.
* **Find position of an element in an Infinite Sorted Array:** Searching for an element in a conceptually infinite sorted array.
* **Index of First 1 in a Binary Sorted Infinite Array:** Finding the index of the first '1' in an infinite binary sorted array.
* **Minimum Difference Element in a Sorted Array:** Finding the element in a sorted array that has the minimum difference with the target element.

## Advanced Binary Search Applications

* **Binary Search on Answer Concept:** Applying binary search to find the optimal answer when the answer space is monotonic.
* **Peak Element:** Finding a peak element in an array (an element greater than its neighbors).
* **Find maximum element in Bitonic Array:** Finding the maximum element in a bitonic array (an array that increases then decreases).
* **Search An Element in Bitonic Array:** Searching for an element in a bitonic array.

This playlist is a valuable resource for anyone looking to master binary search and its various applications, particularly for coding interviews and competitive programming. Aditya Verma's explanations are known for being clear and concise, making complex concepts easier to understand.
